See also README.DOC for general information concerning SPF/PC.

* NOTE! The current SPF2.EXE is a OS/2 1.x 16-bit version.  The
  32-Bit OS/2 version will be available later at no charge.

  Limitations of the 16-Bit version include:

    - Cannot load files larger than ~10Meg.  OS/2 16-bit applications
      only have a 16M swappable address space, meaning that we
      only have 16M of scratch space to deal with.  32-bit applications
      have virtual address spaces of over 1G.

    - Cannot SPLIT/SWAP/VSPLIT when a macro is active.  If a macro or
      a command procedure has executed and suspended, either because
      of an EDIT or a DISPLAY/TBDISPL statement, swap/split is
      disabled.  However, if the macro/command procedure terminates,
      split/swap is re-enabled.

* If you cannot execute an operating system command via panel 6
  or by typing "OS2 XXX" (where XXX is some command), and OS/2
  returns a (-1) try:

    1) executing SPF2.EXE from a CMD prompt in an OS/2 windows or
       full screen session.
    2) If this does work, delete the PM or WorkPlace Shell Icon
       entry for SPF2, and generate a new one from scratch,
       specifying SPF2.EXE as the executable.

  Sometimes during installation, OS/2 loses track of the command
  processor in association with our icon, therefore no operating
  system commands can be issued.  This seems to be a bug the OS/2
  API but is easily worked around by recreating the object.

* In OS/2, you can associate SPF/PC to an icon as follows:

  - Manually add the icon yourself from the Workplace Shell.  As you
    create a Program Item for SPF2.EXE, it will automatically
    associate itself with the SPF2.ICO icon file.

* In OS/2 2.x extended columns are supported by certain drivers and
  video boards.  If supported, you can get into extended video
  modes in OS/2 with the mode command.  For example, to switch
  to 132 x 60 mode, you can use the:

     MODE CO132,60

  OS/2 command from the OS/2 system prompt.

  If you want to switch into this extended mode while inside SPF/PC
  issue the SPF/PC Primary Command:

     OS2 MODE CO132,60

  SPF/PC will automatically adjust to the new screen dimensions.

* If you are running SPFPC.EXE from an OS/2 2.x DOS Box, then you
  may run into some problems loading large files.  In a DOS box,
  SPFPC.EXE executes as if it were in Windows 3.x, so many of the
  Windows specific notes in README.DOS apply to this situation.

  Also, you may want to increase the DPMI_MEMORY_LIMIT to above the
  default 2 megabytes it starts with.  This will enable SPFPC.EXE
  to load larger files.  We suggest 6 megabytes or greater.

* When running SPFPC.EXE from an OS/2 2.x DOS Box, the print screen
  key causes an "Abnormal Termination" error.  This appears to be
  a conflict with OS/2 and the 32-bit DOS Extender.  We recommend
  using SPF2.EXE whenever you are in OS/2.  The "print" command is
  always available to get a screen print and does not generate this
  error.

* When running on a network, your LPT1 port must be mapped to a valid,
  on-line printer.  If not, when you press the print screen key, your
  system will appear to "hang".  Actually, the network is just trying
  to find a printer to service your screen print request.  After almost
  3 minutes, the network will return control to OS/2.  Be sure to map
  LPT1 to a valid printer to avoid this problem.

* If you edit a file with Extended Attributes, the EA's are maintained
  during save.  However, if the profile for the file edited indicates
  BACKUP ON, SPF/2 will perform a COPY of the original file to create a
  backup, and then write the new file back on top of the original, which
  makes the save time essentially twice as long as without EAs.  If the
  file has no extended attributes, the normal procedure of renaming the
  original to the backup file, and then writing the new file occurs.

* If you are running CITRIX OS/2 2.x and you want to use macros, you
  must add the following line to your STARTUP.CMD file (located in the
  root directory of your OS/2 drive):

            "DETACH CAPTIVE REXXINIT"
