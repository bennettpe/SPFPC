# SPF/PC v4 for MS-DOS, FREEDOS, x86

This is the abandonware SPF/PC v4 from around 1993. It's an ISPF-like environment and editor. It also includes a REXX implementation!

It works fine and is fun to use on DOSBOX

This software is as-is. I don't support it, nor will I look at tickets. You're on your own.
