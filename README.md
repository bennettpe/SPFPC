# SPF/PC v4 for MS-DOS, FREEDOS, x86

This is the abandonware SPF/PC v4 from around 1993. It's an ISPF-like environment and editor. It also includes a REXX implementation!

It works fine and is fun to use on DOSBOX. To execute panels commands (e.g. for navigation) press the key (e.g 2) and Control at the same time

This software is as-is. I don't support it, nor will I look at tickets. You're on your own.
