CONTENTS: General information about SPF/PC Version 4.0

***********************************************************************

* The following notes concern SPF/PC Version 4.0 in general.  More
  specific information concerning either DOS or OS2 can be found in
  README.DOS and README.OS2 respectively.  Specific notes on ISREDIT
  macro execution and ISPEXEC command procedures may be found in
  README.MAC.

* How to get Technical Support:

   - By phone, call (510) 521-5900 from 8:00 to 4:30 Pacific Time.
   - By fax, call (510) 521-0369, 24 hours a day.
   - By modem, call our BBS at (510) 769-6826.

* At startup, SPF/PC Version 4.0 performs the following search to find
  the location of its global profile, SPFPC40.GBL:

    - If a environmental variable named SPF4PATH or SPFPATH (we
      look for SPF4PATH first) exists, it looks there first.
    - It next searches the PROFILES subdirectory off of the
      executable directory.
    - It next searches the executable directory.
    - It next searches the current directory.

  Once the GBL global profile is found, it uses the settings stored
  within (and set on Panel 0.8) to locate all other files, including:

    - Panels,
    - Messages,
    - Profiles,
    - Macros,
    - Command Procedures.

  SPF/PC Version 4.0 no longer supports the SPF2PATH environmental
  variable, which was used in earlier versions to find profile
  information.  If you are using it, change it to SPFPATH.

  If you need to use an environmental variable to find the GBL file,
  (in most cases you don't, especially if you have followed the
  default installation configuration), we recommend that you use
  the SPFPATH variable.  However, if you are running verions 3.0
  and 4.0 simulteneously, use the SPFPATH variable to indicate
  the location of Version 3.0 profiles, and SPF4PATH for the
  location of Version 4.0 profiles.

* SPF/PC Version 4.0, by default, keeps its profile information
  in the PROFILES subdirectory underneath the installation directory.
  For example, if you installed into C:\SPFPC40, the profile
  information is stored in C:\SPFPC40\PROFILES.

  If you need to use the SPFPATH variable to point at the profile
  information, set it to point to the PROFILES directory as well.
  In the above example, you would use "SET SPFPATH=C:\SPFPC40\PROFILES".

* If you have one of the following prior releases:

   SPF/2 v 2.0, SPF/PC v 3.0, or SPF/PC v 4.0

  You can make sure that your profiles from those installations are
  moved over into your new release by performing the following
  command from the DOS or OS/2 command prompt:

   PRFUPGRD <old_prf_location> <new_prf_location>

  So, if you had SPF/PC v 3.0 installed in C:\SPFPC30, and you just
  installed SPF/PC v 4.0 into C:\SPFPC40 directory, issue the following
  command:

   C:\SPFPC40\PRFUPGRD c:\spfpc30 c:\spfpc40\profiles

  which should update and copy all the profiles over.

  If you have installed Version 4.0 over an existing installation,
  then perform:

   C:\SPFPC\PRFUPGRD c:\spfpc c:\spfpc

  and all the profiles will be upgraded, and backups of any file
  that gets modified will be made.

* PFSHOW Buttons are on by default; this is so we can show off the
  ability to "double click" the buttons to perform PFKey functions
  with the mouse.  However, if you want the space back for editing,
  use the PFSHOW OFF command.

  If you are using 50 or 60 line mode, you may want to tell SPF to
  display even more rows than the default 2 -- use the PFSHOW 4
  command to display 4.  If you change the PFSHOW setting to show
  3 lines, it will show the default Mouse Selection "S" commands,
  which are assigned by default to the Shift PF Keys.

* Tips regarding modifying distribution panels:

   - If you want to modify one of the panels we distribute with Version
     4.0, copy it to a new directory, and reflect the location of that
     directory in your Panel 0.8 CUSTOM Panel search path.

     Change the panel in the CUSTOM directory.  Then, if you receive an
     update from us, we can overwrite all the panels in the PAN
     directory, and your customized panels will not be touched.

   - The primary option panel is named "S2MPRIM.PAN".  All other
     panels are referenced through it and the functions it calls.

   - You can select alternative startup panels using the /S command
     line switch.  See the Documentation for more details.

* SPF/PC's editor memory requirements are dependent to the MAXIMUM
  RECORD LENGTH field set on Panel 0.5.  By default, Version 4.0 is
  shipped with it set to 4096.  This means that regardless of the
  settings in the specific profile, or the width found within the file
  being editing, the maximum record length cannot exceed the MAXIMUM
  RECORD LENGTH value.

  If you increase the value, then SPF/PC must anticipate wider and wider
  files, which its internal buffers used to keep track of changed
  records.  The larger the value, the more memory the editor requires
  (even if the file in the editor is not using it).

  We recommend that, unless you need to edit long records, you maintain
  MAXIMUM RECORD LENGTH <= 4096.

* SPF/PC's memory requirements during file loads are bound to the
  MAXIMUM RECORD LENGTH of the profile that is loading the file.  During
  the file load process, SPF/PC allocate numerous temporary buffers of
  the same size as the maximum record length.  If the record size is
  unnecessarily large, then extra memory is required during file load.

  SPF/PC starts with a default maximum record length of 4096.  This
  number can be increased on Panel 0.5 up to 64000 bytes.

  We recommend that, unless you use long records, you maintain Maximum
  Record Length <= 4096.

* If you are having trouble editing files that you used to be able to
  edit with SPF/PC Version 2.1, then you most likely need to change some
  of the settings available under the Panel 0.7 Profile Controls.  For
  example:

    - SPF/PC Version 2.1 Variable length record format files are similar
      to SPF/PC Version 4.0 Data delimited files.  However, if you were
      using CRLF terminators under SPF/PC 2.1, it accepted both CRLF
      pairs and lone LF characters as record terminators.

      SPF/PC 4.0 CRLF terminators search only for CRLF pairs, which
      means that if you have a record terminated with only a LF, 2.1
      could read the file, but 4.0 would most likely display the error
      message MAX RECORD LENGTH EXCEEDED.

      SPF/PC 4.0 supports SCRLF terminators (Soft CRLF), which emulate
      the functionality of the SPF/PC 2.1 variable length format.
      Change the LINE TERMINATOR field on the second page of 0.7 profile
      information to from CRLF to SCRLF.  This must be done for all
      profiles that match the extension of the file with this style
      record terminators.  If you use files of this nature extensively,
      then you may want to change the DEFAULT profile settings as well.

    - SPF/PC 4.0 supports Micro Focus Record Sequential Style
      format files, that look entirely different from a standard
      Data delimited file.  Some of the profiles that we distribute
      with SPF/PC include settings for the Micro Focus Header format.

      If you are loading a file into edit and receive the message
      INVALID MF RECORD or HEADER, check the profile settings for
      the file that you are loading.  Most likely, it is set to
      RECORD FORMAT == M.

* New commands not found in the hardcopy documentation:

* New in Version 4.0.0

  * SPLITH - Performs a horizontal split at the halfway point on the
    screen, without regards to current cursor position.  If the
    current screen is already split, repositions split line to mid
    point and performs swap.  Horizontal analog to SPLITV command.

  * SWAP [BACK] [<#>] - Accepts the following new parameters:

      BACK - swaps backwards, in the opposite direction of the normal
             swap order.
      <#>  - swaps directly to the task with task id <#>

  * PRINT ALL|PART [NUMBER] [X|NX]

    Editor only commands to enhance printing output.  The parameters
    are used as follows:

      NUMBER -- Includes line numbers on left side of output in files
                that are not numbered.
      X      -- Print just the lines in the region specified that are
                excluded.
      NX     -- Print just the lines in the region that are not
                excluded.

  * CUT [APPEND]

    Editor command that appends the currently selected to the
    clipboard.  Unlike CUT with no parameters, which erases the
    contents of the clipboard, and then writes the selected
    text, CUT APPEND appends the selected text to the end,
    accumulating additional clipboard text.

  * PASTE [CLEAR]

    Normally, PASTE leaves the contents of the clipboard intact
    after each PASTE so that you can continue to paste the contents
    again.  However, with PASTE CLEAR, the contents are removed
    from the clipboard after pasting.

  * FLIP

    The editor now supports the FLIP primary command, which EXCLUDES
    all the NON-EXCLUDED lines, and Includes the EXCLUDED lines.
    This essentially "flips" that X_STATUS of all the lines in the
    editor.

  * HILIGHT

    Editor only command -- alias for COLORMAP Syntax Colorization
    command.

  * PROFILE <prof_name>
  * LRECL <lrecl_len>
  * IMACRO <imacro_name>
  * XMACRO <xmacro_name>
  * ERRORFILE <errf_name>

    File list only commands that change the default value of the
    respective editor value for the active file list.  For example,
    change the default PROFILE value for the current file list
    by issuing the command:

      PROFILE exe

    All subsequent edits from the active file list will use
    the "EXE" profile, as if you had entered the value on the
    PROFILE field of panel 2.

    These commands only work when the file list is generated from
    either Panel 1 or 2, or if invoked using the EDIT or BROWSE
    primary commands.

* New in Version 4.0.1

  * CMD command, which performs a select on an ISP Command Procedure
    from the command line.  For example, to execute our PHONE.ISP
    REXX Command Procedure from within the editor, issue the command:

      CMD PHONE

    The phone procedure will be executed by performing a select on
    the command line "CMD(PHONE)"

    Parameters may also be included on the command line, and they
    are split off into a seperate argument of the select statement
    as a PARM().

  * Directory list LOCATE command has a new parameter to help it
    locate directories as opposed to file entries.  The new LOCATE
    syntax is:

      LOCATE [DIR] [<col_name>] <col_value>

    For example, to locate a FILE with the name "XYZ.PDQ", execute:

      LOC xyz.pdf

    or

      LOC name xyz.pdf

    However, to locate a DIRECTORY with the name SRC, execute:

      LOC dir src

  * New SPFPC command line parameter "/G", which allows you to overide
    the search path used to find the Global Profile SPFPC40.GBL file.
    For example, if SPF is started as follows:

      SPFPC /Gc:\profiles

    SPF will look in the "c:\profiles" directory to find the Global
    profile file, regardless of the settings of SPFPATH and SPF4PATH
    environment variables.

  * New SPFTRACE environment variable that activates Trace mode without
    extra command line parameters.  For example, by setting

       SET SPFTRACE=Y
       SPFPC

    SPF/PC will echo back all the search file locations that it
    hunts for.  This mode is particularly useful if you are running
    the SPF/PC Micro Focus interface, which does not allow you
    the add extra command line parameters.

* Also not documented but available in Version 4.0:

  Ability to specify file lists via "Set" notation, where multiple
  directories may be scanned for specific file patterns.  For
  example:

    [C:\TEST;D:\TEST2;E:\TEST\NEW] *.c *h

  would generate a list of all "*.c" and "*.h" files found the the
  three directories "C:\TEST", "D:\TEST2", and "E:\TEST\NEW".

  Dialog variables may also be specified anywhere within the file
  specification.  For example:

    [&SPFPATH] *.cbl

  would search for all "*.CBL" files found in the SPFPATH variable
  paths.

  Note:  The above extended path specification formats with
  best from the OS FILE SPECIFICATION fields of Panels 1, 2, and 3.4.
  The can be coerced to work from other areas, such as the PROJECT
  FILE sections of the same panels, but the usage is not as clean.

* ZDSN Style Variables

  The Version 4.0 ZDSN variable set which keep track of the recently
  edited filenames now includes the following variables (in regards
  to C:\SPFPC40\README.DOC):

     ZDSN          {C:\SPFPC40\README.DOC}
     ZDSNPATH      {C:\SPFPC40}
     ZDSNDRV       {C:}
     ZDSNNAME      {README.DOC}
     ZDSNBASE      {README}
     ZDSNEXT       {DOC}

  These variable may be retrieved from within macros via the ISPEXEC
  VGET facility, or may be expanded during FOREGROUND, DOS/OS2/TSO/CMS
  command processing by preceding them with an "&" character.

* New Mouse Capabilities

  - Dragging the Split Line.  If you have a split line (horizontal
    or vertical) displayed in your current full screen task,
    you can hold the left mouse button down and "drag" the split
    line to new locations.
  - PFSHOW Selection.  The PFSHOW Buttons on the bottom of the screen
    not only provide information as to the contents of your basic
    PF Keys setting, but can also be "Double-Clicked" and executed,
    just as if you had hit the real PF-Key.
  - The scroll indicators on all tables (the little arrows at the
    right side of the screen) can be double clicked to perform
    scrolling within the tables.
  - During split, you can use the mouse to change sides of the split
    line, essentially performing a SWAP.

* Command Stacking

  - Unlike SPF/2 1.0, 2.0 and SPF/PC 3.0, command stacking can now
    span over split lines, in and out of the editor, and work around
    = commands.  For example, the command "split;2;;" should start
    working in Panel 2 on the other side of the split that has
    not occured yet.

* Tips concerning use of the Version 4.0 keyboard manager:

  * Any configurable key in the keyboard manager may be used as the
    SPF/PC Enter key, including Enter (the normal "Return" key),
    Enter-Ext (the Enter key on the Extended keypad), Right-Ctrl (the
    Ctrl key on the bottom right corner of an extended keyboard), and
    Ctrl-Enter (the combination of holding down Ctrl and "Return"
    simultaneously).  All of these key entries may be found on the
    EXTENDED key table on Panel 0.K.

    The typical terminal signals to assign to these keys include:

      * [ENTER-3270] - Performs enter processing in SPF, making all
        active changes permanent, and executing whatever commands
        are on the primary or line command lines.  Similar in
        operation to the Enter key on a 3270 keyboard.
      * [ENTER-SPFPC] - Acts like the enter key in SPF/PC Version
        2.1, where Enter key processing occurs only if something has
        been typed into the editor, or if you hit Enter from the
        last field on a DM panel.  Also refered to as "Smart-Enter".
      * [NEWLINE] - Moves the cursor down the screen to the next
        field.  Does not perform enter key processing.

  * The typical signals assigned to the Backspace key include:

      * [BACKSPACE] - "Destructive Backspace," which erases the
        character to the left of the cursor, moves the cursor there,
        and slides all the data from the right over as well.
      * [BACKSPACE-BLANK] - Similar to Destructive Backspace, it
        deletes the character and moves the cursor over to the left,
        but does not slide the data on the right over.
      * [CURSOR-LEFT] - The non-destructive backspace, simply moves
        the cursor over to the left.

  * The typical signals assigned to the Esc key include:

      * [CANCEL] - Clears the terminal entry buffer that has been
        assumulating keystrokes since the last time you hit Enter or
        a PFKey.  This is the default setting for the Esc under all
        of the sample keyboard schemes distributed with Version 3.
      * x"1A" - Associates the ASCII data character for Esc with the
        Esc key, which was an option under SPF/PC Version 2.1.
      * END - Performs the END command, exiting you out of any
        panel; also, saves Edit sessions when a change has occured.

  * The [DEL-END-OF-DATA] signal may be assigned to any configurable
    key, but is typically assigned to either Ctrl End-Ext or Ctrl
    Del-Ext.  Both of these key entries can be found in the CTRL
    key table.

  * The CURSOR command may be assigned to PF12, which evidentally is a
    common configuration on many users 3270 setups.  However, the
    CURSOR command performs Enter key processing, while its terminal
    function counterpart [CURSOR] does not.  In most cases, it is
    desirable to assign the signal [CURSOR] as opposed to the primary
    command CURSOR.

* Notes on modifying Colorization Definition Files (.CLR's)

  - A new, undocumented, colorization category, SPECIAL_CHARS has
    been added so that selected punctuation can be colorized
    differently from normal text.  For example, use:

       SPECIAL_CHARS    = "+/*-="

    to colorize the arithmetic operators in your source code.

    None of the special characters can be included anywhere within
    the WORD_CLASS dictionary.  For example, if you include the
    word "#define" in your WORD_CLASS section, you cannot include
    the character "#" as a special character.

  - String delimiters must be defined with the STRING_DELIMITERS
    header in order for quoted character strings to be colorized.
    For example:

       STRING_DELIMITERS = '"', "'"

    defines both single quote and double quoted strings to be
    colorized.

  - SPF/PC Version 4.0 does not performing any syntactical parsing
    of your source code to determine validity!  Therefore, if
    a word found in the WORD_COLOR classes of your CLR file is used
    out of context, it will get colorized (unless it is found in
    some other colorized context, like a String or a Comment).

* Logical printer definition notes

  * If you specify a SETUP or a RESET string that contains a file
    to output, the file will be dumped "raw."  There will be no
    expansion of "\027" patterns or anything.  Therefore, if you
    need to dump an setup string from a file, imbed real Esc
    characters into the file that gets dumped.

  * Maximum COLUMNS is used to align the header and footer lines
    only.  If you need to print text that is wider than maximum
    columns setting, it will print -- and if your printer wraps,
    it will wrap the text down to the next line without telling
    us that it has done so.

* Overloaded Profile Names in 4.0.2

  SPF/PC will rename profiles for PRN, AUX, and CON based files
  so that they use "_PRN", "_AUX", and "_CON" instead.  This is
  to avoid profiles that use files names that conflict with DOS
  device filenames (ie: in DOS, if you write to a file named
  "PRN.PRF", like we normally would if we were handling a PRN
  profile, you write to your printer instead).

* Documentation Addendums:

  The following items are not correct in the documentation, and
  should be as follows:

* Users of the Keytronics KB3270 Keyboard maybe able to use the
  KB3270 mapping on Panel 0.K to enable all the extra PF-Keys.

  Call our technical support department at (510) 521-5900 for
  details.

* SPF/PC Version 4.0 includes extra support utilities for the
  Concurrent Mode, where SPF/PC meters the quantity of users on the
  system.  These files, SPFMAINT.EXE and UINSTALL.EXE, are intended to
  be used by sites where a Concurrent License has been specialized
  purchased; misuse of these utilities may cause an unusable
  configuration where no users are allowed on.
